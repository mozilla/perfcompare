# Deployments

PerfCompare is hosted on Netlify, and is updated every time commits are pushed to the following branches:

| Branch Name | URL                                            | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| production  | https://perf.compare/                          | Production branch, updated every 1-2 weeks. |
| main        | https://main--mozilla-perfcompare.netlify.app/ | This is the current development branch.     |

Every pull request will be deployed as well to a separate domain, whose link will be added automatically to the PR in a comment.

## How to deploy main to production

The easiest by far is to
[create a pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/perfcompare/compare/production...main?expand=1).
It would be nice to write down the main changes in the PR description.

### Gather the main changes

Here is how you can gather the changes since the last deploy:

1. Gather all the code changes:

```
git fetch upstream && git log upstream/production..upstream/main --first-parent --oneline --no-decorate --format="format:[%an] %s" --reverse
```

2. You'll probably need to adjust it manually: remove some useless commits (such
   as the dependency updates), fix some authors (as merge commits aren't always
   using the same author as the Pull Request author).

### Create a merge commit

After the PR is created all checks should run. When it's ready the PR can be
merged. Be careful to always use the **create a merge commit** functionality,
not _squash_ or _rebase_, to keep a better history.

Once it's done the new version should be deployed automatically. You can follow the
process on [Netlify's dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mozilla-perfcompare/deploys)
if you have access.

## How to revert to a previous version

The easiest way is to reset the production branch to a previous version, and
force push it. You'll need to enable force-pushing for the branch production,
using the [Branch Settings on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/perfcompare/settings/branches).

You can use the following script:

```
sh bin/revert-last-deployment.sh
```

When you're ready with a fix landed on `main`, you can push a new version to the
`production` branch as described in the first part.
